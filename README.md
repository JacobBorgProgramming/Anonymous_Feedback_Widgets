# Anonymous Feedback Widgets
Anonymous feedback widgets built for use with PanelBear Analytics

---

### Every website owner wants to get user feedback...

But many of the existing user feedback options invade the website owner's and users' privacy. However, PanelBear Analytics makes privacy respecting feedback possible.

### Disclaimer

This project is NOT endorsed by PanelBear.

This project is designed to work with PanelBear. Thus, the easiest way to implement these wigdets requires a PanelBear account, or you can dissmantle and rebuild using a different analytics platform.

### How to use

First: add a PanelBear snippet inside your site's <head></head> tags.

Second: copy the snippet template script.

Third: paste the template where you want the widget to appear on the website.

Fourth: insert the tracking information for your widget (name of action, etc) into the designaed locations in the snippet. Each of these elements is marked with "TEMPLATE".

PS: The widgets are written to use Bootstrap CSS (Not included), but you can change this :D
